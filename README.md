4. **Develop API Endpoint (`POST /api/upload_repo`):**
   - **Create Router for Repository Endpoints:**
     - Organize API endpoints related to repository operations within dedicated router modules.
   - **Implement Upload Endpoint:**
     - Develop the `upload_repo` endpoint to:
       - Receive GitHub repository URLs from the frontend.
       - Validate the received URL to ensure it points to a legitimate GitHub repository.
       - Temporarily handle the received data, with plans to integrate a database in Sprint 2.
     - Provide meaningful responses to the frontend, indicating whether the upload was successful or if errors occurred.

5. **Set Up CORS:**
   - **Configure CORS Middleware:**
     - Implement Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings to allow the frontend application to communicate with the backend API.
     - Define allowed origins, methods, and headers to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access.

6. **Environment Configuration:**
   - **Create Environment Files:**
     - Set up environment configuration files (e.g., `.env`) to manage sensitive information and configuration settings.
     - Define environment variables for configurations such as database connections and API settings.
