1. **Configure Repository:**
   - **Initialize Git Repository:**
     - Create a new Git repository for the backend project.
     - Host the repository on a platform like GitHub to facilitate version control and collaboration.
   - **Set Up `.gitignore`:**
     - Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files and directories such as virtual environments, compiled files, and environment variables.
     - This maintains repository cleanliness and security by preventing sensitive information from being committed.

2. **Set Up Development Environment:**
   - **Install Python and Poetry:**
     - Ensure that Python is installed on the development machine.
     - Install Poetry, a dependency management and packaging tool for Python, to manage project dependencies efficiently.
   - **Initialize FastAPI Project:**
     - Set up a new FastAPI project using Poetry to handle dependencies and project configuration.
     - Organize the project structure with directories for routers, models, and schemas to maintain clean and manageable code.

3. **Install Requirements:**
   - **Add FastAPI and Uvicorn:**
     - Install FastAPI for building the backend API.
     - Install Uvicorn as the ASGI server to run the FastAPI application.
   - **Install Additional Dependencies:**
     - Add any other necessary dependencies, such as `python-dotenv` for environment variable management and CORS middleware for handling cross-origin requests.

4. **Develop API Endpoint (`POST /api/upload_repo`):**
   - **Create Router for Repository Endpoints:**
     - Organize API endpoints related to repository operations within dedicated router modules.
   - **Implement Upload Endpoint:**
     - Develop the `upload_repo` endpoint to:
       - Receive GitHub repository URLs from the frontend.
       - Validate the received URL to ensure it points to a legitimate GitHub repository.
       - Temporarily handle the received data, with plans to integrate a database in Sprint 2.
     - Provide meaningful responses to the frontend, indicating whether the upload was successful or if errors occurred.

5. **Set Up CORS:**
   - **Configure CORS Middleware:**
     - Implement Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings to allow the frontend application to communicate with the backend API.
     - Define allowed origins, methods, and headers to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access.

6. **Environment Configuration:**
   - **Create Environment Files:**
     - Set up environment configuration files (e.g., `.env`) to manage sensitive information and configuration settings.
     - Define environment variables for configurations such as database connections and API settings.
   - **Secure Handling of Environment Variables:**
     - Ensure that environment variables are securely managed, especially for production environments, to prevent exposure of sensitive data.

7. **Version Control Integration:**
   - **Initial Commit:**
     - Commit the initial FastAPI project setup, including the `upload_repo` endpoint and CORS configuration, to the Git repository.
   - **Push to Remote Repository:**
     - Push the committed changes to the remote GitHub repository to ensure that the project is backed up and accessible to all team members.

8. **Documentation:**
   - **Utilize FastAPI’s Documentation Features:**
     - Leverage FastAPI’s automatic documentation generation (Swagger/OpenAPI) to document the `upload_repo` endpoint.
     - Ensure that the endpoint is clearly described, including request and response formats, to aid frontend developers in integrating the API.
